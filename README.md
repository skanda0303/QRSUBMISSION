‚úÖ This version uses:
- Proper **Markdown headings** (`#`, `##`, `###`)  
- **Code blocks** for commands and project structure  
- Clean separation of sections for readability  

If you want, I can also **add a ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù section** with tips for saving outputs to the `outputs/` folder and running batch processing, so it matches your script perfectly. Do you want me to do that?
